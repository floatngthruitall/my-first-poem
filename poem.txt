A Beautiful Poem And The Opposite Poem and Mummies

Roses are red
Violets are blue
I like beefaroni
And other stuff too.

One verse is good
Better is two
Here is my edit
Here is a read-thru.

One last verse
To write it is good
To read it to another
You know that you should.

But what if roses weren't red
If roses weren't blue
That would be surpringly
Did you truly think it through?


Or Are Mummies Better?
